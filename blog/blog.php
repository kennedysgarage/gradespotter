					<p>We have just pushed out our first update and I could not be more proud our little app. The best part of building any project is getting the chance to make improvements on it. This means that the product has value and is worth to continue pushing forward with the idea. I have be hitting the street and asking a lot of people for their feedback, everyone from other UX professionals, restaurant owners, and anyone else that was willing to listen to me. We took all of these ideas and laid them out and ordered them based on importance. From there we have broke it down into a few versions, a roadmap of sorts. We are extremely happy to announce Grade Spotter 1.1!</p>

					<p>Grade Spotter is a full-featured restaurant inspection guide for your iPhone. Whether it’s a five-star restaurant or a hole-in-the-wall secret, each New York City restaurant must adhere to a standard of rules and regulations when dealing with food. With over 24,000 restaurants in the city one must question a restaurant’s sanitary principles at one point or another. Separate from taste and appearance, what food actually deserves an A and what food should be thrown in the garbage? Grade Spotter provides the NYC Health Department Restaurant Inspection Grades in a one-stop, user-friendly format and helps you make an informed decision on where to go.</p>
