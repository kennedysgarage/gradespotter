			<p>Launched in April 2012, Grade Spotter is headquartered in New York City and was founded by <a href="http://twitter.com/kennedysgarage">Kennedy</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/rjowens">Richard Owens</a>. Currently available in the US</p>
			<p>This revolutionized way of eating all started when Grade Spotter founders, Christopher Kennedy and Rich Owens, went to their favorite lunch spot one afternoon to only to find it had a "Grade Pending" sign on its window. Kennedy was perplexed to find that Grand Sichuan had health code violations because according to his taste buds, it had the best General Tso’s chicken in town.  After a few weeks upon initially asking themselves why, they decided to investigate. Kennedy and Owens soon realized that their favorite lunch spot had betrayed them with its dirty habits. Notes such as "Live roaches present in facility’s food" and "No facilities available to wash, rinse and sanitize utensils and/or equipment," were only a few things that were on the long list of hygiene faux pas. Shortly after this discovery, Kennedy and Owens took it upon themselves to make sure that the rest of New York City would not be duped. Grade Spotter helps you read between the grades and choose the best food &mdash; clean food.</p>
